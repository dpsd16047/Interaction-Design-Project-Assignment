# Introduction
**Brief:** Our team intends to design and program a system, which will interact with the user via sound and music; using *Arduino*. This specific Arduino we are going to develop, will be attached on the user's hat; or any other cloth accessory, while the device itself being protected. 

# Summary
Up to now, we have the Brief of the project and some research based on PACT.

# 1st Deliverable
**People:** Our project refers to children, especially between ages three and ten years old (*our Target Group*). The creators of this project are: Odysseas Voutsaras, Kyriakos Chatzichristos and Christina Kontzinou. Finally, some Potential stakeholders we have in mind are: "Jumbo", "Kids", "Google" and "Apple".  
**Activities:** The users are either playing Musical chairs, or any other games (involving music or not), with each other without using any technologies (for example, using applications to start/pause the music automatically - for Musical Chairs). The only technology needed until this moment is playing music, either from a smartphone (YouTube, Spotify, or the user's local library) or from a CD player.  
**Context:** Musical chairs is a beloved game for people of all ages, and always seems to bring out some good laughs. The original musical chairs game can be played with children as young as age three, but works best for children around age seven and up. Traditionally, chairs are arranged in either a circle, or two rows back-to-back, and there is always one chair less than the number of people playing the game. The music starts, everyone walks in a circle around the chairs, and when the music stops everyone must sit on a chair. The last person standing without a chair is then out. The game continues until only one person remains. Playing musical chairs offers great opportunities for improving physical coordination, social skills, and emotional regulation. You can further add specific musical goals as well, such as, exposure to a variety of cultural music songs, walking with the steady beat of the music, and switching the direction of walking to show the musical form (structure) of the music. Musical Chairs is a game played (usually) at Home, School or the Playground.  
**Technologies:** *Hybrid play* (Arduino used in playgrounds) is a device for parents and their children; they are able to experience and create new virtual adventures, and play them in playgrounds and parks; where the playground becomes a control interface. Hybrid Play promotes outdoor physical activity, verbal communication, and teamwork. An other diachronic game is *Hide and Seek*, which nowadays can be played online with random team-players or opponents. A very good example of that, is one Escape Room which was built during the quarantine, "Cartman's Escape Room".
We are planning to use: Tinkercad (for prototyping) and LilyPad Sewable Electronics Kit.
